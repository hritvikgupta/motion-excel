## Built-In Data Scientist Agent & Interactive Dashboard  
We’ve built an intelligent Data Scientist Agent that seamlessly runs advanced machine-learning models on your data and delivers interactive dashboards with actionable insights in seconds.  

- Deploy pre-built ML models (e.g., forecasting, classification, anomaly detection) directly from within the spreadsheet environment  
- Generate dynamic dashboards with drill-downs, real-time updates, chart types selected automatically by the agent  
- Monitor model accuracy, feature contributions, and key performance metrics through user-friendly visualizations  
- Democratize data science: non-technical users can ask questions in natural language and receive both insights and visual reports
